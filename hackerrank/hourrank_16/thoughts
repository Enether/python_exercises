I did pretty badly on this one, considering it took me 10 minutes alone
to grasp what's required for the first problem - Candy Piles.
That took me around 30 minutes to solve, which was pathetic.

The second problem - Lucky Number - I managed to solve in some 5 minutes with the full score.

20 minutes were spent on the third problem - Magic Number Tree - to which I barely managed to provide
a semi-working solution that scored 9 points out of the maximum 60. I was left with 5 more minutes which I
decided to spend on trying to improve my Candy Piles solution.
In retrospect, that may have been the wrong move since I did not manage to score the extra 2 points I was missing there.

Regardless, I managed to achieve rank 79/1799, which I think speaks pretty badly about the other competitors.
Hey, at least it's a silver medal :)
