The solutions here are left as what they originally were, meaning I have not refactored any of them. Needless to say, all of the code is incredibly ugly and uses bad bad practices (global variables galore).

I managed to score ~500 points 1:30 hours into the contest.
In the end, I ranked 17th out of 149 with 664/1000 points, which is not bad and puts me at the top 12% (or 15% if we want to round up).
I'm not too satisfied though, I wasted an hour on the Lumber problem, trying to improve my score. In the end, I didn't manage to change it and ended with 20/100 on that problem. :( I tried using a QuadTree data structure to compare the logs but it seems like my approach was wrong. I still don't know what the correct solution to that problem is.
