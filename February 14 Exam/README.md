This sure was a grueling exam. Nothing went 100/100 with the first try and I blame most of that on my lack of focus.
A note for future exams: take the exam seriously, read the challenge carefully and, on a piece of paper, write down all the small goals you should do, then check them off one at a time.
What you need to do once you think you've come up with a solution is to write the solution down on either a multi-line comment or on a physical piece of paper. I'm sure this exam would have been immensely easier had I done that. 
Also think about all possible scenarios.
