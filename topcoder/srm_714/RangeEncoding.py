"""
You are given a arr that contains a set of positive integers. The elements in arr are all distinct
and they are given in increasing order.

A range is a finite set of consecutive integers. Formally, for any two positive integers a â‰¤ b the range [a,b]
is defined to be the set of all integers that lie between a and b, inclusive.

For example, [3,3] = {3} and [4,7] = {4,5,6,7}.

You want to represent the set given in arr as a union of some ranges. Return the minimum number of ranges you need.
